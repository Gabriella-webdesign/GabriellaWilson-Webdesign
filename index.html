            <p><center> Now that the fall season has started,<br>the sweltering hot days have departed.<br> The sun goes down earlier than usual.<br>But that makes sunsets waymore beautiful.<br> Outstanding colors are everywhere,<br> it is hard not to  stop and stare.<br> The colors of fall: orange, yellow, white and red,<br> makes me want to spend my time outside instead.<br>The most <em> important</em> thing about fall, <br><strong> is how happy it makes us all.</strong></center> </p>
